# Height To Human
### v1.0

Built by Whitney Mitchell, July 6, 2016

Front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. Answers the question, "How many Danny Devitos tall is the Batman Building?"

Using Angular-js, Angular Bootstrap, and CSS animations, I've built an app that converts the height of people into that of buildings. The user may select from a database of people, and a database of structures, then convert the height of the structure into a measurement based on the selected person's height. Users may also provide their own name and height to use in converting a structure's height.
Results views are sharable through a 'Share' button that copies the results URL to the user's clipboard.
Additionally, 'Recent Conversions' are accessible through a modal available in every view. The modal displays the last 10 conversions of selected people and structures.
